    <h1>summer 2022 research<br>the balloon analogue risk task (BART)</h1>

          <br>
    <p>
      My summer research project involved examining the role played by anxiety sensitivity (i.e., the <em>fear of fear</em>, <a href="https://www.scirp.org/(S(i43dyn45teexjx455qlt3d2q))/reference/referencespapers.aspx?referenceid=255510">
      see Reiss and McNally, 1985)</a> across different constructs related to risk: risk perception, risk attitude, and risk-taking. The BART was used as an objective measure of risk-taking. <br> <br>This was my first foray into 
      implementing code of any kind into a survey software. The survey software I used is called Unipark.de. It is a great tool, but there was a bit of a learning curve for me
      because it is in German, and I cannot stress to you enough that I do not speak German. Fortunately, most parts will translate if you use the right internet engine.
       If you are interested in using Unipark.de, there are some online tutorials <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzT8U07NL1s"><b>here</b></a>, or you can always email me. 
    </p> 
    <p>
      Even though many risky behaviours generate the somatic arousal feared by individuals with high AS, to my knowledge, only two studies (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11196285/"><b>here</b> 
      </a> and <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-37459-003"><b>here</b>)</a> have examined the role of AS in relation to risk-taking. The first found high (vs. low) AS 
      scores to be associated with a greater reported incidence of high-risk sexual practices, and less frequent substance abuse. This study, however, relied only on self-report, which raises 
      questions about whether responses were distorted due to factors such as self-serving biases, inattention, or strategic motives. 
      The second study found that when placed under conditions of risk in a gambling task, individuals with high AS engaged in significantly less risk-taking than their low AS counterparts. 
      While this study did use a behavioural measure, the measure has not been found to model real-world risk taking, limiting result generalizability. 
      <br><br>
      This research is expected to contribute to the literature on conceptualizations of risk perception, attitude, and taking, and provide insight into how risk perception and risk attitude may 
      differentially inform risk-taking based on levels of AS. Better understanding risk offers benefits for applied research (e.g., improving risk communication programs), for methodological 
      research and for humans, all of whom engage in risks every day.
