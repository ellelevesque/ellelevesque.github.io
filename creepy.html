      <h1>creating deepfakes</h1>
        <p>Devising a method to examine the role of behaviour in perceiving creepiness was a harder task than I thought. I soon realized how difficult it would be to <em>ethically</em> create a dataset which containted both static facial images and videos of "creepy" people. My supervisor published a study which, in the pilot, established a database of "creepy" static facial images. But it's not like we could contact these individuals; some of them were listed as America's Most Wanted, and some of them were robots (and we all know how flippant robots can be).</p>
          <div style='padding-top: 10px'></div>
        <p>One day, I stumbled upon a silly video of a dog, which someone had edited to sing a song, and I realized it might be possible to apply the same principles used in that video to static facial images. If they could make the dog sing, I thought to myself, perhaps I could add subtle movement to images. <br> <br> <strong>For scientific reasons only,</strong> here's that video:</p>

          <div style='padding-top: 10px'></div>
        <p>Anyways, I had absolutely no idea where to start in creating something like this. Fortunately, there was a <a href="https://github.com/AliaksandrSiarohin/first-order-model">public repository</a> available for people to create these things, called deepfakes. Countless video tutorials later, I was able to take the motion patterns from a driving video of myself (see below) and synthesize them on to a static image.</p>
          <div style='padding-top: 10px'></div>
        <p>Here is one of the very first that I made:</p>
          <div style='padding-top: 10px'></div>
            <img src="images/demo_dynamic.gif" alt="creepiness poster" width="560">
          <div style='padding-top: 10px'></div>
        <p>From there, I was able to make a dynamic facial image for every static one. I used three different motion patterns and randomly assigned a motion pattern to each facial image.</p>
        <img src="images/Presentation1.gif" alt="deepfake" width="700px">
        <p><em>To be honest, I was surprised I managed to do this.</em><br> All in all, it was quite a rewarding experience when I <em>finally</em> figured out how it could be done, and I hope
        that my future research endeavours will offer me opportunities to explore coding further.</p>

    <p>I am a firm believer in open science and data. As such, I intent to make the data publicly available for my thesis after it has been submitted for publication. 
        In the meantime, please email me with any questions.
